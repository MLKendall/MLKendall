### Hi there!  I'm Mandy, nice to meet you!

I am a senior-level developer and [IAAP Certified Web Accessibility Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification#About%20WAS) at [Sparkbox](https://sparkbox.com/). I specialize in web accessibility and design systems, but I am also excited to be learning [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

I am also:
-  📷 An [experimental photographer](https://mkendallphotography.com/) working in infrared and stereo photography
-  💧 A [Penn State Master Watershed Steward](https://extension.psu.edu/programs/watershed-stewards)
-  🎣 A Fishing Skills Instructor with [PA Fish and Boat Commission](https://www.fishandboat.com/Pages/default.aspx)
-  🐟 A member of [Trout Unlimited](https://www.tu.org/) and 🌲 PA Parks and Forests Foundation
-  🏕️ An avid love of all things outdoors (but especially hiking, fly fishing, and kayaking)

Have an environmental, education, or climate change project you'd like some technical help with? [Let's chat!](mailto:mlkendall93@gmail.com)
